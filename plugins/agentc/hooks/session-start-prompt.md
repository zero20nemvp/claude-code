You have AgentC - superpowers methodology with cognitive-load-reducing interface.

## Core Workflow

```
/add-north-star → Socratic questioning to unearth guiding direction
/add-goal       → WOOP methodology to create milestones
/next           → Get ONE optimal task (AI dispatched in parallel)
/do             → Execute with TDD discipline + automatic code review
/done           → Record with verification evidence
```

## The Discipline

**For every code task:**
1. **TDD**: Write test → See RED → Implement → See GREEN → Refactor
2. **Code Review**: Automatic after /do completes
3. **Verification**: Must see actual test output before /done

**The system enforces:**
- One task at a time (zero decision fatigue)
- AI handles parallelizable work
- You focus on creative/judgment tasks
- Evidence before completion claims

## Quick Reference

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/next` | Get next optimal task |
| `/do` | Start task with TDD |
| `/done` | Complete with verification |
| `/status` | See all north stars and progress |
| `/now` | Quick current task check |

## Skills Available

All superpowers skills are embedded:
- `test-driven-development` - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
- `systematic-debugging` - 4-phase root cause investigation
- `brainstorming` - Socratic design refinement
- `writing-plans` - Bite-sized implementation tasks
- `verification-before-completion` - Evidence before claims
- And 17 more...

**To use a skill:** The Skill tool will invoke them as needed by commands.

## Getting Started

If no north stars exist: `/add-north-star`
If north stars exist: `/next`
